# Qucik Description
## About:
This repository is used to renew automatically my account on D-Wave for using quantum annealers for solving quadratic unconstrained optimisation algorithms.
## Content:
This repository will contain all my developements using D-Wave for solving real-wolrd QUBOs. It will remain freely accessible to the research community.
